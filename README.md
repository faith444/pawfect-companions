# Pawfect Companions

Pawfect Companions is a creative static website that I built as part of my HTML lab practical. The project is centered on pets, adoption, and care, and it demonstrates the use of semantic HTML, accessibility features, and multimedia. It was a chance to put into practice what I have been learning about structuring web pages, using different HTML5 elements, and creating an interactive experience without relying on CSS or JavaScript.

## Live Site
The project is hosted through GitHub Pages and can be viewed here:  
üëâ [Pawfect Companions Live Site](https://faith444.github.io/pawfect-companions/)

## Pages Overview

The site is divided into four main pages, each focusing on a different theme:

### Home (index.html)  
The homepage welcomes visitors to Pawfect Companions. It introduces the site with a warm message about caring for pets of all kinds and provides a quick tip for owners. It also demonstrates the use of semantic layout with `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`.

### About (about.html)  
The About page explains key pet terminology across categories like cats, dogs, birds, and fish. It also includes an ‚ÄúAbout Me‚Äù section with my name so that the site feels personal. This page shows the use of `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<aside>` to keep information well-structured.

### Media (media.html)  
The Media Gallery showcases different types of media. It includes an image of a cat with a scarf, another of a dog with glasses, an audio clip of a kitten meowing, and a video of puppies for adoption with captions. All images are wrapped in `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`, and the video demonstrates the use of a `.vtt` captions file. Media credits are also listed at the bottom of the page.

### Extras (extras.html)  
The Extras page, titled ‚ÄúExtra Treats,‚Äù brings together fun and interactive elements. It includes a weekly cat feeding schedule in a table, quick facts in collapsible sections, and a Vet‚Äôs Corner with Dr. Lois‚Äô contact information. It also demonstrates interactive HTML elements like `<details>`, `<summary>`, `<progress>`, and `<meter>`. Finally, it uses microcontent such as `<time>`, `<mark>`, `<abbr>`, and a `<blockquote>` for variety.

## Features
Some of the main features of the project include:
- Semantic structure with proper headings and sections on every page.
- A skip link for accessibility.  
- Internal navigation that connects all four pages.  
- Use of `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` for images and `<track>` captions for video.  
- Organized file structure with assets separated into images, audio, video, and captions.  
- Interactive HTML elements including tables, details/summary, dialog, progress, and meter.  
- Microcontent such as `<time>`, `<mark>`, `<abbr>`, and `<blockquote>`.  
- Meta tags for charset, viewport, description, and canonical included in each page.  
- Passed W3C validation with no errors.  

## Notes
This project was a chance to practice building a clean, accessible website using only HTML5. It shows how a combination of semantic tags and multimedia can create a site that is both educational and engaging, even without styling or scripting.
