# Pawfect Companions

Pawfect Companions is a simple pet-themed website that I created for my HTML and CSS lab project. The site is meant to demonstrate how to build a structured, accessible, and visually clear website while still keeping it fun and creative. The theme of the site is pet adoption and care, and each page shows different aspects of this idea.

## Live Website
You can view the published website here:  
 [Pawfect Companions Live Site](https://faith444.github.io/pawfect-companions/)

## GitHub Repository
The full project files are available in my GitHub repository:  
 [Pawfect Companions Repository](https://github.com/faith444/pawfect-companions)

The repository includes the HTML pages, the CSS styling file, and extra files like audio, video, and images.

## Pages Overview
- **Home (index.html):** Introduces the website and explains the importance of adoption. Includes a welcome message, a helpful tip for pet care, and a motivational quote.  
- **About (about.html):** Shares information about different types of pets and explains pet terms like canine, feline, avian, and aquatic. Also contains my author section.  
- **Media (media.html):** Displays different media such as pet images, a kitten meowing audio, and a video of puppies with captions.  
- **Extra Treats (extras.html):** Includes a feeding schedule table, fun pet facts, a short vetâ€™s note, progress and health meters, and trivia presented in an interactive way.  

## Design Choices
For the design, I used a soft and simple palette that keeps the site easy on the eyes. The text is structured using a clear type scale, with larger headings for page titles and smaller text for explanations. I kept enough spacing between sections so that the site feels open and easy to navigate. The layout is consistent across all pages, with a header, navigation menu, main content, and footer.

## Accessibility
Accessibility was a key focus. I included alt text for images, captions for the video, and a skip link to help keyboard users jump directly to the main content. The color contrast was chosen to keep the text readable, and semantic tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` make the site easier to understand for assistive technologies.

## Containerization with Docker
Finally, I used Docker with an nginx server image to serve the site and published the container image to Docker Hub so it can be reused.
